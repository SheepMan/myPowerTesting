UC Berkeley Energy Management
=============================
Energy Management is a companion mobile application to the MyPower energy initiative campus site,
located at http://mypower.berkeley.edu.

Outline
-------
The application is written using jQuery Mobile on the frontend, and Rails on the backend.
The energy data is pulled from an API provided by a group at the UC Berkeley RAD Lab, whose 
project homepage is located here: (http://code.google.com/p/smap-data/).  The energy data is
rendered as a graph using the HighCharts JavaScript library.
